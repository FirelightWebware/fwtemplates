Templates for Firelight Webware documents

Included is a Markdown template we use for defining application specs, as well
as the css file to style it properly. By keeping specs in Markdown format,
we can easily track changes as we go through the discovery process (and
beyond). This way, the client doesn't have to reread the whole spec document
just to get the gist of a few changes.
